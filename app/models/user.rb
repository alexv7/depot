# This exception serves two purposes. First, because it is
# raised inside a transaction, it causes an automatic rollback. By raising the
# exception if the users table is empty after the deletion, we undo the delete and
# restore that last user.
# Second, the exception signals the error back to the controller, where we use
# a begin/end block to handle it and report the error to the user in the flash. If
# you want only to abort the transaction but not otherwise signal an exception,
# raise an ActiveRecord::Rollback exception instead, because this is the only exception
# that wonâ€™t be passed on by ActiveRecord::Base.transaction.
