<!-- Note the use of the sanitize() method for the description. This allows us to
safely add HTML stylings to make the descriptions more interesting for our
customers. Note that this decision opens a potential security hole(cross-site scripting), but
because product descriptions are created by people who work for our company,
we think that the risk is minimal. -->
