  # Note that since title_html and add_html end in the characters _html, we are free to
  # use HTML entity names for characters that do not appear on our keyboard.
  # If we did not name the translation key this way, what you would end up seeing
  # on the page is the markup. This is yet another convention that Rails has
  # adopted to make your coding life easier. Rails will also treat names that contain
  # html as a component (in other words, the string .html.) as HTML key names.

  # %n is a placeholder for the number; &nbsp; is a nonbreaking space character,
